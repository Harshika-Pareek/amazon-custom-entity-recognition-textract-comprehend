DESCRIPTION
IPV6, formerl named Ing (next generation), is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP) IP
is a packet-based protocol used to exchange data, voice, and video traffic over digital networks
Cisco's Wide-Area Application Services IPV4 users can move to IPV6 and receive services such
as end-to-end security, quality of service (Qos), and globally unique addresses. The IPV6 address
space reduces the need for private addresses and Network Address Translation (NAT) processing
by border routers at network edges.
Implementing basic IPv6 connectivity in the Cisco IOS software consists of assigning IPv6
addresses to individual router interfaces. The forwarding of IPV6 traffic can be enabled globally,
and Cisco Express Forwarding switching for IPV6 can also be enabled
The primary motivation for IPv6 is the need to meet the demand for globally unique IP
addresses
Mainly involves to checks the functionality of all waas features to work with v6 addressing

WAAS product portfolio. WAAS Express is a cost-effective, IOS-based, WAN optimization solution
that increases the amount of available bandwidth for small-to-mid-size branch offices and remote
locations, while accelerating TCP-based applications that operate in a WAN environment.
The Wide-Area Application Services (WAAS) Express software optimizes TCP traffic flows across
a WAN. WAAS Express integrates with native services such as security, NetFlow, and quality of
service (Qos) WAAS Express provides the following benefits:
Bandwidth optimization
Application acceleration
Increase in remote user productivity
Interoperation with existing Cisco WAAS infrastructure
Network transparency
Deployment flexibility with on-demand service enablement
The Wexp is about the wide Area Application Service on IOS (Router) itself.
