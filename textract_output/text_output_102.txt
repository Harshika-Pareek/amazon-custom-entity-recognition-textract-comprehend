BIRT Reports
BTRAMROOO1SYSER. rptdesign (Work order report):
My client was using default BTRAMR2 Work order reports. They also use a different work order
report in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as
No Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions
Empty boxes, lot of missing information
Not align with Systems objectives and processes
Historical context on the asset is missing
Esthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive
No bar coding used
The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give
them simplicity to input information. It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services
divisions.
This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and
failure reporting information.
Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.
It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page
numbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset
automatically) I have implemented this option in this report.
Language ranslation was used for this report in German and French
I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.
BTRAMR0009. .rptdesign (Availability Report):
This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a
Availability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work
order parameters.
Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to
be able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.
BTRAMR0027. rptdesign (Card Stock Report)
Existing report functionality:
Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The
technician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where
he scans its work order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo.
when we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab
the Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order.
Objectives:
Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by
