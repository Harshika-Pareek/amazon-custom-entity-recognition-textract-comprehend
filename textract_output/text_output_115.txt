Pune, Maharashtra Email me on Indeed: indeed.con/r/Girish-Acharya/6757f94ee9f4ec2
I would like to describe myself as a hard-core software engineer and technical architect
passionate for technology and someone who loves to take challenges head-on I have been using
combined engineering principles wherein I was responsible for designing, developing, testing,
deploying and monitoring highly scalable distributed applications and services.
While I have always been working using Microsoft technologies, I got chance to work for Microsoft
in as a full-time employee last year. My focus as part of this role was as a Dev Ops/Site Reliability
Engineer. The main requirement of this role was to keep-lights-on in all data centers for Windows
Developer Center. While Service Engineering aspect was the main requirement, I used my
technical architect and software tools for inside-out and outside-in monitoring and telemetry.
As a technical architect, I have worked in Accenture for about 7+ years. My role @ Microsoft
account was to demonstrate technical leadership, design technical architecture, propose
and introduce standard design and architectural patterns and practices, incorporate new
requirements and feedbacks from client and execute multiple quick prototypes. As part of this
role I architected Microsoft IT's (MSIT) biggest Platform As A Service (Paas) solution back in
the days.
I have executed multiple client facing projects wherein I was responsible for designing,
architecting the compute, storage, application and deployment architecture. I have experience
in designing and architecting systems for Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/
DR strategies). I have designed and architected solutions for "Testing in production". I have
experience in designing and architecting for extremely high scale 3 billion requests/day). I
have designed and implemented auto healing, smooth traffic routing and eventual consistency
in multiple client facing projects.
I am in the Information Technology industry since 2001 working for various software organizations
in India for 4 years till I joined Accenture in 2006. I came to USA in 2010 and was working as
consultant for Microsoft. I joined Microsoft in May 2015 as a full-time employee. I earned my
Electronics Engineering degree in year 2000, Diploma in Advance Computing degree in year 2001
and completed Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and Enterprise Architect certification
(MCPDEA) in year 2007. I am also Microsoft Azure Certified Developer and Architect.
I am frequent community contributor. I blog at http://girishthegeek.wordpress.com/
I have worked and published an asset called Framework for Ops Team considering Windows Azure
and it was very well received by the clients and appreciated by the managers.
I wrote a white paper related to AppFabric Service Bus which got published in MSDN.
